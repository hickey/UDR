The files located in the contrib directory are to assist building packages
for various Linux OSes. The following are a few notes to assist in buiding
binary packages for RedHat/CentOS and Debian/Ubuntu. 

RedHat/CentOS
=============

In order to build RPM packages, one must tar up the UDR distribution (either 
from a downloaded tar file or the GitHub repository) with the filename
udr-<VERSION>.tar.gz. This file need to be deposited in the SOURCES directory 
where your rpmbuild command will find it. Usually either /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES
or ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES. 

Once the source distribution file has been put in the proper location, the 
following command can be executed to build a binary RPM. 

	rpmbuild -bb udr.spec

The resulting RPM can be found in one of the following locations:

	~/rpmbuild/RPMS/<arch>/udr-<VERSION>-<RELEASE>.<arch>.rpm
	/usr/src/redhat/RPMS/<arch>/udr-<VERSION>-<RELEASE>.<arch>.rpm


Debian/Ubuntu
=============

Debian packages are built using the same source distribution file as used
for RedHat/CentOS. The difference being that the file needs to be named
udr_<VERSION>.orig.tar.gz and place in the top level directory (i.e. the 
parent directory where you found this README file). 

Debian packages are build with the following command from the directory
that contains the debian directory:

	debuild -b -uc -us

The resulting package will be in the top level directory and be named
udr_<VERSION>-<RELEASE>.<arch>.deb. Also not that this package will not 
be signed with a GPG key and thus should not be distributed through a 
publicly available repository.
