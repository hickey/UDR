The files located in the contrib directory are to assist building packages
for various Linux OSes. The following are a few notes to assist in buiding
binary packages for RedHat/CentOS and Debian/Ubuntu. 

RedHat/CentOS
=============

In order to build RPM packages, one must tar up the UDR distribution (either 
from a downloaded tar file or the GitHub repository) with the filename
udr-<VERSION>.tar.gz. This file need to be deposited in the SOURCES directory 
where your rpmbuild command will find it. Usually either /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES
or ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES. 

Once the source distribution file has been put in the proper location, the 
following command can be executed to build a binary RPM. 

	rpmbuild -bb udr.spec

The resulting RPM can be found in one of the following locations:

	~/rpmbuild/RPMS/<arch>/udr-<VERSION>-<RELEASE>.<arch>.rpm
	/usr/src/redhat/RPMS/<arch>/udr-<VERSION>-<RELEASE>.<arch>.rpm


Debian/Ubuntu
=============

Debian packages are built using the same source distribution file as used
for RedHat/CentOS. The difference being that the file needs to be named
udr_<VERSION>.orig.tar.gz and placed at the same level as the UDR source
directory. The contrib/debian directory then needs to be copied to the 
top level of the UDR source directory. 

Debian packages are build with the following command from the UDR source
directory: 

	debuild -b -uc -us

The resulting package will be in the directory alongside the UDR source
directory and be named udr_<VERSION>-<RELEASE>.<arch>.deb. Also not that 
this package will not be signed with a GPG key and thus should not be
distributed through a publicly available repository.
